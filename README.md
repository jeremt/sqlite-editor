# SQLite editor

A simple in-browser SQL editor to test to SQL queries easily.

Try it [here](https://sqlite-editor.vercel.app).

## Why this? ðŸ¤”

The other day, I did a introductory workshop about SQL.

I didn't want the students to have to do all the installation because the workshop was about SQL not install ðŸ˜…

I looked for a simple online tool to easily run SQL queries and visualize tables, but I didn't find any ðŸ˜­

So I decided to make one ðŸ˜¬

I'm also working on a [website to learn code](https://codepassport.dev) to I already made an online code editor. Also, sqlite is written in C, so its easily compiled to WASM ([https://sqlite.org/download.html](https://sqlite.org/download.html)). Thanks to those 2 things I could make a simple version quite fast.

I might improve it later but feel free to use it or contribute ðŸ˜Ž

## TODO

- Allow to import .sql scripts
- Enable autocomplete based on db schema
- Show errors directly in editor with tooltip
- Create tables from UI
- Add/Remove/Edit columns from UI
- Add rows from UI
- Make everthing less ugly
