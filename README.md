## Why this? 🤔

The other day, I did a introductory workshop about SQL.

I didn't want the students to have to do all the installation because the workshop was about SQL not install 😅

I looked for a simple online tool to easily run SQL queries and visualize tables, but I didn't find any 😭

So I decided to make one 😬

I'm also working on a [website to learn code](https://codepassport.dev) to I already made an online code editor. Also, sqlite is written in C, so its easily compiled to WASM ([https://sqlite.org/download.html](https://sqlite.org/download.html)). Thanks to those 2 things I could make a simple version quite fast.

I might improve it later but feel free to use it or contribute 😎

## How to contribute? 👀

There is no specific guidance since it's a quite small project. If you find have an idea or find a bug you can create an issue or better yet open a pull request fixing the issue 😏
